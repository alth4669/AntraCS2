A StringBuilder should be used if a string needs to add/delete new characters or substrings
on the fly.

2. The Array class is the base class for all other types of arrays.

3. The base Array class contains a built-in sort method, Array.Sort() which will re-order
in place the values of an array.

4. Array.Length gets the total number of elements in an array

5. No, multiple data types can't be stored in an System.Array object. All elements must be
of the same data type.

6. System.Array.CopyTo() will copy the contents of the currently in-use one dimensional array
to a specified target one-dimensional array starting at a particular index in the target array.
